The\n   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the\n   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the\n   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order\n   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by\n   the caller.\n\n   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding\n   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any\n   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead\n   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the\n   decoding tables.\n   */\n\n  /* accumulate lengths for codes (assumes lens[] all in 0..MAXBITS) */\n  for (len = 0; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    count[len] = 0;\n  }\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    count[lens[lens_index + sym]]++;\n  }\n\n  /* bound code lengths, force root to be within code lengths */\n  root = bits;\n  for (max = MAXBITS; max >= 1; max--) {\n    if (count[max] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root > max) {\n    root = max;\n  }\n  if (max === 0) {                     /* no symbols to code at all */\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;  //here.op = (var char)64;    /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;   //here.bits = (var char)1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;   //here.val = (var short)0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n    opts.bits = 1;\n    return 0;     /* no symbols, but wait for decoding to report error */\n  }\n  for (min = 1; min < max; min++) {\n    if (count[min] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root < min) {\n    root = min;\n  }\n\n  /* check for an over-subscribed or incomplete set of lengths */\n  left = 1;\n  for (len = 1; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    left <<= 1;\n    left -= count[len];\n    if (left < 0) {\n      return -1;\n    }        /* over-subscribed */\n  }\n  if (left > 0 && (type === CODES || max !== 1)) {\n    return -1;                      /* incomplete set */\n  }\n\n  /* generate offsets into symbol table for each length for sorting */\n  offs[1] = 0;\n  for (len = 1; len < MAXBITS; len++) {\n    offs[len + 1] = offs[len] + count[len];\n  }\n\n  /* sort symbols by length, by symbol order within each length */\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    if (lens[lens_index + sym] !== 0) {\n      work[offs[lens[lens_index + sym]]++] = sym;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /*\n   Create and fill in decoding tables.

This totals 48 bits, or six bytes.\n      Therefore if strm.avail_in >= 6, then there is enough input to avoid\n      checking for available input while decoding.\n\n    - The maximum bytes that a single length/distance pair can output is 258\n      bytes, which is the maximum length that can be coded.  inflate_fast()\n      requires strm.avail_out >= 258 for each loop to avoid checking for\n      output space.\n */\nmodule.exports = function inflate_fast(strm, start) {\n  var state;\n  var _in;

(default `true`)\n * @returns A Uint8Array containing the UTF-8 encoding of the input string.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * JavaScript strings are composed of Unicode code points. Code points are\n * integers in the range 0 to 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF). When serializing a string,\n * it must be encoded as a sequence of words. A word is typically 8, 16, or 32\n * bytes in size. As such, Unicode defines three encoding forms: UTF-8, UTF-16,\n * and UTF-32. These encoding forms are described in the Unicode standard [1].\n * This function implements the UTF-8 encoding form.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * In UTF-8, each code point is mapped to a sequence of 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes.\n * Note that the logic which defines this mapping is slightly convoluted, and\n * not as straightforward as the mapping logic for UTF-16 or UTF-32. The UTF-8\n * mapping logic is as follows [2]:\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0000..U+007F, then view it as a 7-bit\n *   integer: 0bxxxxxxx. Map the code point to 1 byte with the first high order\n *   bit set to 0:\n *\n *       b1=0b0xxxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0080..U+07FF, then view it as an 11-bit\n *   integer: 0byyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 2 bytes with the first 5 bits\n *   of the code point stored in the first byte, and the last 6 bits stored in\n *   the second byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b110yyyyy    b2=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0800..U+FFFF, then view it as a 16-bit\n *   integer, 0bzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 3 bytes with the first\n *   4 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the second byte,\n *   and the last 6 bits in the third byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b1110zzzz    b2=0b10yyyyyy    b3=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+10000...U+10FFFF, then view it as a\n *   21-bit integer, 0bvvvzzzzzzyyyyyyxxxxxx. Map the code point to 4 bytes with\n *   the first 3 bits stored in the first byte, the next 6 bits stored in the\n *   second byte, the next 6 bits stored in the third byte, and the last 6 bits\n *   stored in the fourth byte:\n *\n *       b1=0b11110xxx    b2=0b10zzzzzz    b3=0b10yyyyyy    b4=0b10xxxxxx\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * It is important to note, when iterating through the code points of a string\n * in JavaScript, that if a character is encoded as a surrogate pair it will\n * increase the string's length by 2 instead of 1 [4]. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * > 'a'.length\n * 1\n * > '💩'.length\n * 2\n * > '語'.length\n * 1\n * > 'a💩語'.length\n * 4\n * ```\n *\n * The results of the above example are explained by the fact that the\n * characters 'a' and '語' are not represented by surrogate pairs, but '💩' is.\n *\n * Because of this idiosyncrasy in JavaScript's string implementation and APIs,\n * we must \"jump\" an extra index after encoding a character as a surrogate\n * pair. In practice, this means we must increment the index of our for loop by\n * 2 if we encode a surrogate pair, and 1 in all other cases.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * References:\n *   - [1] https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/UnicodeStandard-12.0.pdf\n *         3.9  Unicode Encoding Forms - UTF-8\n *   - [2] http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/UTF-8-UTF-8-Encoding.html\n *   - [3] http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/UTF-8-UTF-8-Encoding-Algorithm.html\n *   - [4] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length#Description\n *\n */\nexport var utf8Encode = function (input, byteOrderMark) {\n    if (byteOrderMark === void 0) { byteOrderMark = true; }\n    var encoded = [];\n    if (byteOrderMark)\n        encoded.push(0xef, 0xbb, 0xbf);\n    for (var idx = 0, len = input.length; idx < len;) {\n        var codePoint = input.codePointAt(idx);\n        // One byte encoding\n        if (codePoint < 0x80) {\n            var byte1 = codePoint & 0x7f;\n            encoded.push(byte1);\n            idx += 1;\n        }\n        // Two byte encoding\n        else if (codePoint < 0x0800) {\n            var byte1 = ((codePoint >> 6) & 0x1f) | 0xc0;\n            var byte2 = (codePoint & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            encoded.push(byte1, byte2);\n            idx += 1;\n        }\n        // Three byte encoding\n        else if (codePoint < 0x010000) {\n            var byte1 = ((codePoint >> 12) & 0x0f) | 0xe0;\n            var byte2 = ((codePoint >> 6) & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            var byte3 = (codePoint & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            encoded.push(byte1, byte2, byte3);\n            idx += 1;\n        }\n        // Four byte encoding (surrogate pair)\n        else if (codePoint < 0x110000) {\n            var byte1 = ((codePoint >> 18) & 0x07) | 0xf0;\n            var byte2 = ((codePoint >> 12) & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            var byte3 = ((codePoint >> 6) & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            var byte4 = ((codePoint >> 0) & 0x3f) | 0x80;\n            encoded.push(byte1, byte2, byte3, byte4);\n            idx += 2;\n        }\n        // Should never reach this case\n        else\n            throw new Error(\"Invalid code point: 0x\" + toHexString(codePoint));\n    }\n    return new Uint8Array(encoded);\n};\n/**\n * Encodes a string to UTF-16.\n *\n * @param input The string to be encoded.\n * @param byteOrderMark Whether or not a byte order marker (BOM) should be added\n *                      to the start of the encoding.

The\n * UTF-16 mapping logic is as follows [2]:\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+0000..U+FFFF, then map the code point to\n *   a 16-bit integer with the most significant byte first.\n *\n * • If a code point is in the range U+10000..U+10000, then map the code point\n *   to two 16-bit integers. The first integer should contain the high surrogate\n *   and the second integer should contain the low surrogate. Both surrogates\n *   should be written with the most significant byte first.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * It is important to note, when iterating through the code points of a string\n * in JavaScript, that if a character is encoded as a surrogate pair it will\n * increase the string's length by 2 instead of 1 [4]. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * > 'a'.length\n * 1\n * > '💩'.length\n * 2\n * > '語'.length\n * 1\n * > 'a💩語'.length\n * 4\n * ```\n *\n * The results of the above example are explained by the fact that the\n * characters 'a' and '語' are not represented by surrogate pairs, but '💩' is.\n *\n * Because of this idiosyncrasy in JavaScript's string implementation and APIs,\n * we must \"jump\" an extra index after encoding a character as a surrogate\n * pair. In practice, this means we must increment the index of our for loop by\n * 2 if we encode a surrogate pair, and 1 in all other cases.\n *\n * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n *\n * References:\n *   - [1] https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode12.0.0/UnicodeStandard-12.0.pdf\n *         3.9  Unicode Encoding Forms - UTF-8\n *   - [2] http://www.herongyang.com/Unicode/UTF-16-UTF-16-Encoding.html\n *   - [3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length#Description\n *\n */\nexport var utf16Encode = function (input, byteOrderMark) {\n    if (byteOrderMark === void 0) { byteOrderMark = true; }\n    var encoded = [];\n    if (byteOrderMark)\n        encoded.push(0xfeff);\n    for (var idx = 0, len = input.length; idx < len;) {\n        var codePoint = input.codePointAt(idx);\n        // Two byte encoding\n        if (codePoint < 0x010000) {\n            encoded.push(codePoint);\n            idx += 1;\n        }\n        // Four byte encoding (surrogate pair)\n        else if (codePoint < 0x110000) {\n            encoded.push(highSurrogate(codePoint), lowSurrogate(codePoint));\n            idx += 2;\n        }\n        // Should never reach this case\n        else\n            throw new Error(\"Invalid code point: 0x\" + toHexString(codePoint));\n    }\n    return new Uint16Array(encoded);\n};\n/**\n * Returns `true` if the `codePoint` is within the\n * Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
